# CS6350_HW3
There are 3 models of Perceptron located in the module MLib, Perceptron(length=xdim), VotedPerceptron(length=xdim), and AveragePerceptron(length=xdim). They must be initialized with the dimensions of X (not including augmentation). To train them, pass in a numpy array train_X with a row per datapoint and train_Y is an array of labels, non-augmented into Perceptron.train(train_X, train_Y, r=.001). r may be adjusted but has a default value of .001. To test the function, pass in testing data formated the same as the training data like so: Perceptron.test(test_X, test_Y). The test function will return an error based on the dataset and Perceptron model. Calling Perceptron.train(-) multiple times will refine the Perceptron further and each call to train is refered to as an epoch.
